# Stitch UI Dropzone

Paste your Google Stitch exports in this folder.

## File Organization Requirements
-   **Kotlin/Compose Code**: Save as `.kt` files.
-   **HTML/CSS**: Save as `.html` files (we will reference these for design).
-   **Assets**: Put images/icons in a subfolder or directly here.
-   **Instructions**: If there are specific text instructions, save as `instructions.txt`.

Once pasted, let me know, and I will begin integrating them into the app.
