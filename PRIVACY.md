# Privacy Policy for CallBlockerPro

**Last Updated**: January 11, 2026

## Introduction

CallBlockerPro ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our call blocking application.

## Our Privacy-First Approach

**CallBlockerPro is 100% local and private.** We do not collect, transmit, or share any of your personal data with third parties or our servers.

## Data We Access

To provide call blocking functionality, the app requires access to:

### 1. Phone State & Call Logs
- **Purpose**: To screen incoming calls and display your call history
- **Storage**: All call logs are stored locally on your device in an encrypted database
- **Transmission**: Never transmitted to any server

### 2. Contacts
- **Purpose**: To identify trusted contacts and prevent blocking your friends/family
- **Storage**: Contact information is processed locally and never stored separately
- **Transmission**: Never transmitted to any server

### 3. Phone Permissions
- **Purpose**: To block/allow calls and manage call screening
- **Usage**: Only used for the core call blocking functionality
- **Transmission**: No call data is ever transmitted

## Data Storage

- All data is stored **locally on your device only**
- Database is encrypted using **SQLCipher** (bank-grade encryption)
- Sensitive preferences are stored using **EncryptedSharedPreferences**
- **No cloud sync** - your data never leaves your device

## Data We Do NOT Collect

We do NOT collect, store, or transmit:
- ❌ Your phone number
- ❌ Your call history
- ❌ Your contacts list
- ❌ Your location
- ❌ Device identifiers
- ❌ Usage analytics
- ❌ Crash reports
- ❌ Any personal information

## Internet Access

**CallBlockerPro does not use internet access.** The app does not have the `INTERNET` permission, making it technically impossible to transmit any data.

## Third-Party Services

We do not use any third-party services, analytics, or advertising networks.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the app and on this page.

## Data Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- Uninstalling the app will delete all associated data
- You can clear app data through Android Settings → Apps → CallBlockerPro → Storage → Clear Data

- View all stored data within the app
- Delete specific entries (call logs, blocklist items)
- Export your data (CSV export feature)
- Completely remove all data by uninstalling the app

**Summary**: CallBlockerPro is a privacy-first app. Your data stays on your device, encrypted and secure. We cannot access your data because we never receive it.
